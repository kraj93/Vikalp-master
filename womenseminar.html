									<h3> NATIONAL SEMINAR ON WOMANHOOD THROUGH THE LENS OF MEDIA, 5TH MARCH, 2014.</h3>
								</header>
								

							<p align="justify">
									
A woman epitomizes ‘Shakti’ in the Indian social thought who is identified as a mother, daughter, wife and so many related forms. She is the ones who faces ‘social Audit’ at every stage of her life, at home and society at large. Her vulnerability and strength becomes ‘News’ for those who scrutinize her at any given point of time. The media has become the prime organization who puts her through this audit.<br>
Of late, media is becoming commercial rather than a reformer, being oblivious to its responsibilities. This is a situation when large no of women are working in various media organisations. The media enjoys fair protection under Article 19 of the constitution but a right is always accompanied by a duty.<br>
 These duties have to be well understood and for this, USLLS and Vikkalp Law Society in collaboration organized a National Seminar on womanhood through the lens of media on the 5th of March, 2014.<br>
There were four Suggested themes for the Seminar:<br>
•	Portrayal of womanhood through the lens of media: Socio-legal dimensions<br>
•	Media trial of sexual offences : Legal sanctity<br>
•	Typecasting women as the subjugated : Representing women in media and TV Serials<br>
•	Projecting feminism: Advertisements and Television shows.<br>
There were a total of 50 participants from different college around India like IIT Kharagpur, Jwaharlal Nehru University, NLU, Delhi, NLU, Kochi, Symbiosis University, Pune, Nirma University Ahmadabad,  Delhi University who presented their research paper.<br>
The event was inaugurated by the Vice Chancellor of IP University, Prof Anup Beniwal and the dean of USLLS, Prof M. Afzal Wani . The chief guests were Arfa Khan and Prof. C.P Singh.<br>
The event was organized by Vikkalp Law Society. There were 7 core team members who were the heads of 5 different responsibilities like Registration of the teams, hospitality etc. Each core team member had around 5 volunteers for assistance, who are the working volunteers of the organization<br>
